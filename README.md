# AgriYield

AgriYield is a project focused on predicting agricultural yields using data-driven approaches. The project leverages datasets related to rainfall, temperature, pesticide usage, and historical yields to build predictive models.

## Project Structure

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AdityaC-0605/Agri-Yield.git
    cd AgriYield
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    - Open `Yield_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    - Ensure you have Python 3.x and the following packages installed:
        - pandas
        - numpy
        - matplotlib
        - scikit-learn
        - seaborn
        - (Any other packages used in the notebook)

    You can install the required packages using:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
    ```

3. **Run the notebook:**
    - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```
    - Open `Yield_Prediction.ipynb` and run the cells to explore the data and model predictions.

## Data

The `res` folder contains the following datasets:
- `pesticides.csv`: Data on pesticide usage.
- `rainfall.csv`: Historical rainfall data.
- `temp.csv`: Temperature records.
- `yield.csv`: Crop yield records.

## Outputs

- `tree.dot` and `tree.png` are likely outputs from model visualization (e.g., decision tree).
